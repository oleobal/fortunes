Les ingénieurs modernes ne respectent plus rien ! Si on les laissait faire,

l’établissement des chemins de fer.

Modern engineers have no respect for anything anymore! Were they let free to
act, they would fill in the seas with the mountains and our globe would then
be nothing more than a ball, smooth and polished like an ostrich egg,
conveniently set up for the establishment of railway lines
