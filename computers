Mazor and I went to the airport to meet Masatoshi Shima, who was arriving from
Tokyo.  So we met, and Shima said, "I'm here to check.  I'm here to check." 
"Okay, great."  So we went to the office, and Shima  immediately asked to
check.  So I asked Mazor if what I had was all that we had, or if there was
something else, because Shima insisted that he wanted to check the logic, that
was apparently promised that it was done.  And Mazor said, "No, that’s all we
have. [...]  Yeah, and Shima looked this thing over and a few minutes later
said, "This is not what I came to do!"  He was really mad!  He was saying:
"This is idea.  This is not design.  I want... I came here to check, and there
is nothing to check!"  He was really, really upset!  And I said, "Well, you
know, I just joined the company yesterday."  "Yeah, you bad!  You bad!"

That brings me to Dennis Ritchie.  Our collaboration has been a thing of beauty.
In the ten years that we have worked together, I can recall only one case of
miscoordination of work.  On that occasion, I discovered that we both had
written the same 20-line assembly language program.  I compared the sources and
was astounded to find that they matched character-for-character.  The result of
our work together has been far greater than the work that we each contributed.

The differences between Kernighan Ritchie Thompson are real but very
subtle.  We all look alike (middle aged with scruffy graying beards).

Kernighan has written ten times as much readable prose as has
Ritchie, Ritchie ten times as much as Thompson.  It's tempting to say
that the reverse proportions hold for code, but in fact Kernighan and
Ritchie are more nearly tied and Thompson wipes us both out.

By the way, 'em' stands for 'editor for mortals' - I christened it that after
Ken Thompson visited our lab at QMC while I was developing it and said

  want to see the state of the file when I'm editing".

He asked for "italic small caps," but there simply hadn't been any historically
-- or there hadn't been until the digital age -- so it didn't really seem worth
doing them. But I couldn't find an answer out of the argument, the semantic
argument "What do you do if?" except to draw them. And the result is something
I would never have thought to do myself, which is now my favorite part of
the typeface -- the italic small caps.
