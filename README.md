## Fortunes

At one point I got frustrated with quotes online. You can never be be sure a quote is real, or correctly attributed; in any case, it'll never have been properly sourced in a quickly verifiable way. I assume the creation of Wikiquote had similar problems in mind.

Here are some quotes I have collected. Some are well known and I only included them so I could quickly find them (and their original source!). Others are virtually unknown, I just happened to like them when I read them.

### Usage

Can be used as-is, or can be run through `strfile` to produce `.dat` files that `fortune` can read. (e.g. `strfile computers /usr/share/fortune/computers.dat`)

I assume this preprocessing step was a good idea back when computers were terrible and the world was primitive.
